# IoT Android App client displaying remote Android Things sensor values in Realtime

This is the client of an Android Things IoT Project that reads temperature data from linked Bluetooth Low Energy sensors.

## Introduction

## Project description

Using a Mobile phone, a Raspberry Pi 3B runing the Android Things OS and three Texas Instruments Sensors Tags connected with the board over Bluetooth Low Energy, the project shows how to monitor the heating temperature of a flat with sensors located at different rooms. Tempearature measurements are uploaded to the Cloud and displayed in a remote Android App client in real time (actually sensor readings are only uploaded every five seconds and that's why the readings seem not in real time, but they are almost).
